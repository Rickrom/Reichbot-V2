# DiscordBots
Library that lets you interact with discord bot websites.
> npm install node-discordbots --save

# About
Well you should be able to tell what this package does. It adds support for both of the biggest Discord Bot websites.
> https://discordbots.org and https://bots.discord.pw

This library lets you interact with their api's.

# Creating a Client
Since there are two websites being supported, you'll need to create seperate clients for both of them.
For all of the clients, you'll first have to initiate them with a constructor with no options like the following
```JS
const Client = new Library();
```

## Creating a Client for <a href="https://bots.discord.pw">Discord Bots</a>
It's simple! Just use

```JS
const DiscordBots = Client.createDiscordBotsClient({
	token : "TOKEN", 
	clientID : "BOT / CLIENT ID"
})
```

In the clientID option you put your client id... 
In the token option you put your api token from <a href="https://bots.discord.pw/api/">here</a>

## Some Examples using Discord Bots
```JS
// Grabs a Discord Bot Owner
DiscordBots.grabUser("166179284266778624").then(response => {
	// Returns a Response of a Object 
	console.log(response);
})

// Post Bot Statistics
DiscordBots.postStats(client.guilds.size).then(response => {
	console.log(response);
})
```
